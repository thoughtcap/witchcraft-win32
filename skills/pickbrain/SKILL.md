# Pickbrain — Semantic Search for Claude History

Search past Claude Code conversations, memory files, and authored files using semantic search.

## Installation

Build and install from the repo root:

```bash
make pickbrain-install
```

This builds the binary, hardlinks it to `~/bin/pickbrain`, and (on Windows) copies the OpenVINO model files to `~/.pickbrain/assets/`. Small assets (tokenizer, config) are embedded in the binary via the `embed-assets` feature; the OpenVINO model is loaded from disk because it's accessed via file path, not byte buffer. Override the asset location with `WARP_ASSETS=<dir>` if needed.

## Usage

Run `pickbrain` via Bash with the user's query:

```bash
pickbrain "$ARGUMENTS"
```

Pickbrain automatically ingests new sessions, memories, and project config files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and their @ references) before each search.

## Interpreting Results

Each result includes:
- **Timestamp** and **project directory**
- **Session ID** and **turn number** — identifies the exact conversation turn
- **Matching text** — the relevant chunk from the conversation

Present results as a concise summary. Quote the most relevant excerpts. If the user wants to dig deeper into a specific session, use `--dump`:

```bash
pickbrain --dump <session-id> --turns <start>-<end>
```

## Filtering

To search within the current (calling) session:

```bash
pickbrain --current "<query>"
```

To search within a specific session by ID:

```bash
pickbrain --session <session-id> "<query>"
```

To exclude the current (calling) session from results:

```bash
pickbrain --exclude-current "<query>"
```

To exclude specific sessions by ID (comma-separated or repeated):

```bash
pickbrain --exclude <uuid1>,<uuid2> "<query>"
pickbrain --exclude <uuid1> --exclude <uuid2> "<query>"
```

To search only recent history:

```bash
pickbrain --since 24h "<query>"
pickbrain --since 7d "<query>"
pickbrain --since 2w "<query>"
```

## Notes

- First run requires a full ingest+embed pass (~7s). Subsequent searches auto-ingest incrementally.
- The database lives at `~/.pickbrain/pickbrain.db`.
- Results are ranked by semantic similarity — they may not contain the exact query words.
- The active session's JSONL is skipped during ingest if it was indexed less than 10 minutes ago. If the active session can't be detected, everything is ingested eagerly.
